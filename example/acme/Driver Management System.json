If you are interested in using this API, you can apply for access on the [**Drivers Product Page**](https://developer.uber.com/products/drivers \"https://developer.uber.com/products/drivers\").\n\nOur Drivers API lets you build services and solutions that make the driver experience more productive and rewarding. With the driver’s permission, you can use trip data, earnings, ratings, and more to shape the future of the on-demand economy. Through the Drivers API you can:\n\n*   [**Get a drivers profile**](https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/references/api/v1/partners-me-get \"https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/references/api/v1/partners-me-get\")\n*   [**Get a drivers trips**](https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/references/api/v1/partners-trips-get \"https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/references/api/v1/partners-trips-get\")\n*   [**Get a drivers payments**](https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/references/api/v1.2/partners-payments-get \"https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/references/api/v1.2/partners-payments-get\")\n\n[¶](https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/tutorials/api/introduction#registering-your-app \"https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/tutorials/api/introduction#registering-your-app\")\n\n Registering Your App\n\nBefore you dive into the code, you first need to register an application on our [**Developer Dashboard**](https://developer.uber.com/dashboard/ \"https://developer.uber.com/dashboard/\"). This is where you will find all of your tokens and information about your app.\n\n**Note:** Organization accounts are not currently supported. Please check out the [**FAQs**](https://developer.uber.com/docs/riders/faq#im-a-developer-signing-up-an-account-for-my-companyorganization-what-account-details-should-i-use \"https://developer.uber.com/docs/riders/faq#im-a-developer-signing-up-an-account-for-my-companyorganization-what-account-details-should-i-use\") for more details.\n\n[¶](https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/tutorials/api/introduction#creating-an-app \"https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/tutorials/api/introduction#creating-an-app\")\n\n Creating an App\n\nThe first step is to create an app. Open the [**developer dashboard**](https://developer.uber.com/dashboard/ \"https://developer.uber.com/dashboard/\") and you should see an option to create a new app. If you already have some apps, the option will be in the top right corner.\n\nClicking this will bring you to the app registration page, where you need to fill in some information about your app. Give it a name and a brief description of what your app will do.\n\nYour app is now registered and ready to setup!\n\n[¶](https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/tutorials/api/introduction#familiarizing-yourself-with-the-dashboard \"https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/tutorials/api/introduction#familiarizing-yourself-with-the-dashboard\")\n\n Familiarizing Yourself with the Dashboard\n\nThe Developer Dashboard contains a wealth of important information about your app. Throughout the setup, we will be referencing information from the dashboard, so take some time to familiarize yourself with it now.\n\nThe dashboard consists of several tabs, but for this tutorial you will only need to use the Auth tab.\n\n[¶](https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/tutorials/api/introduction#auth-tab \"https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/tutorials/api/introduction#auth-tab\")\n\n Auth tab\n\nThe Auth tab is where you can find your app’s Client ID, Client Secret and Server Token, configure the URLs your app will use for authentication, and specify your app signature (more on that later). This is also where you specify what scopes your app will request from the user. Note that there are two types of scopes, General and Privileged. We will discuss the difference in the next section.\n\n[¶](https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/tutorials/api/introduction#choosing-the-right-scopes \"https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/tutorials/api/introduction#choosing-the-right-scopes\")\n\n Choosing the Right Scopes\n\nScopes grant permission to various API endpoints for your app, and will be shown to the user during OAuth. It’s best to limit the scopes you need to the bare minimum so that users can feel confident with your app and the amount of data it can access.\n\nAdditionally, there are two types of scopes: General & Privileged.\n\n[¶](https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/tutorials/api/introduction#general \"https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/tutorials/api/introduction#general\")\n\n General\n\nGeneral scopes allow you access information about the user, but do not allow more advanced actions, such as requesting an Uber on their behalf.\n\n[¶](https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/tutorials/api/introduction#privileged \"https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/tutorials/api/introduction#privileged\")\n\n Privileged\n\nPrivileged scopes allow advanced actions, such as requesting a ride, but require your app to be approved by our team before it can be used by a wider audience. During development, however, your account (and any developer accounts you list on the dashboard) will be able to authorize these scopes without whitelisting.\n\nMore in depth information on our scopes can be found in the [**scopes guide**](https://developer.uber.com/docs/riders/guides/scopes \"https://developer.uber.com/docs/riders/guides/scopes\").\n\n[¶](https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/tutorials/api/introduction#application-ids-tokens \"https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/tutorials/api/introduction#application-ids-tokens\")\n\n Application IDs & Tokens\n\nApp ParameterDescriptionclient\\_idThe _client\\_id_ identifies your application. Treat it like a username.client\\_secretThe _client\\_secret_ is your application’s password. Protect it like a password and use the application dashboard to get a new one should you ever suspect it has been leaked.server\\_tokenThe _server\\_token_ can be used to make calls from your server that do not require a user context.\n\n**Congratulations! You have setup an app in the developer dashboard and now have the credentials required to build an application for Drivers.**\n\n[¶](https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/tutorials/api/introduction#where-to-go-from-here \"https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/tutorials/api/introduction#where-to-go-from-here\")\n\n Where to go from here\n\nGet started implementing the driver endpoints with your preferred tools:\n\n*   [**Curl**](https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/tutorials/api/curl \"https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/tutorials/api/curl\")\n*   [**Python**](https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/tutorials/api/python \"https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/tutorials/api/python\")\n\nDon’t see your language? There are [**official and community client libraries**](https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/guides/client-libraries \"https://developer.uber.com/docs/drivers/guides/client-libraries\") for popular languages to help you get started building moving experiences for Uber drivers.","title":"Driver Management System","version":"0.0.1"}}
